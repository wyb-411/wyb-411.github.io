## What Is This?

This is a reusable **Skill** (structured system prompt) for AI coding agents — such as [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), and other tools that support the `SKILL.md` format — that dramatically improves the design quality of AI-generated HTML/CSS/JavaScript artifacts.

It distills the core design philosophy from [Claude Design](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-design-anthropic-labs)'s system prompt into an open, portable, and customizable skill file that you can drop into any project.

### The Problem

Modern LLMs can already produce functional web pages from simple prompts. But their output tends to converge on the same aesthetic: Inter font, blue primary buttons, purple-pink gradients, large-radius cards, emoji as icons, fabricated testimonials. Technically correct, visually generic.

### The Solution

This skill injects **design taste** into the AI's decision-making process through:

- **Anti-cliché rules** — an explicit blocklist of overused AI design patterns
- **Design system declaration** — forces the AI to articulate color, typography, spacing, and motion choices *before writing code*
- **oklch color theory** — perceptually uniform color derivation instead of random hex guessing
- **Curated font & color pairings** — high-quality starting points that replace the default Inter + #3b82f6
- **Placeholder philosophy** — honest `[icon]` markers instead of poorly drawn SVG fakes
- **Structured workflow** — six-step process from requirements → context → design system → v0 draft → full build → verification

│       ├── style-recipes/                # 25 anchored style recipes — one .md file per anchor, loaded on demand
│       │   ├── INDEX.md                   #   Catalog index + 3 cross-indexes + cross-cutting anti-patterns
│       │   ├── linear.md / aesop.md / pentagram.md / ...    #   25 single-recipe files

└── ...
```

Or use the Claude Code plugin marketplace from the collection root — see the [top-level README](../../README.md#install).

The agent will automatically pick up the skill when your request involves visual/interactive front-end work.

## How It Works

### The Six-Step Workflow

```
1. Understand requirements  →  Ask only when information is insufficient
2. Gather design context    →  Code > screenshots; never start from nothing
3. Declare design system    →  Colors, fonts, spacing, motion — in Markdown, before code
4. Show v0 draft early      →  Placeholders + layout + tokens; let the user course-correct
5. Full build               →  Components, states, motion; pause at key decision points
6. Verify                   →  Pre-delivery checklist; no console errors, no rogue hues
```

### Key Design Principles

**Anti-AI-cliché checklist.** The skill explicitly bans:
- Purple-pink-blue gradient backgrounds
- Left-border accent cards
- Inter / Roboto / Arial / Fraunces / system-ui fonts
- Emoji as icon substitutes
- Fabricated stats, fake logo walls, dummy testimonials

**oklch color system.** Colors are derived in the perceptually uniform oklch space. Same lightness values actually *look* the same brightness to the human eye — unlike HSL, where yellow-at-50% looks much brighter than blue-at-50%.

**Curated starting points.** Six pre-validated color × font pairings for common use cases:

| Style | Color | Fonts | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| Modern tech | Blue-violet | Space Grotesk + Inter | SaaS, dev tools |
| Elegant editorial | Warm brown | Newsreader + Outfit | Content, blogs |
| Premium brand | Near-black | Sora + Plus Jakarta Sans | Luxury, finance |
| Lively consumer | Coral | Plus Jakarta Sans + Outfit | E-commerce, social |
| Minimal professional | Teal-blue | Outfit + Space Grotesk | Dashboards, B2B |
| Artisan warmth | Caramel | Caveat + Newsreader | Food, education |

**Anchored style-recipe library (25 named recipes, progressively loaded).** When the user names an anchor ("Linear-style", "Aesop feeling", "Pentagram-grade type"), the agent reads **only the matching file** at `references/style-recipes/<anchor>.md` (~50 lines). The catalog index, 3 cross-indexes, and cross-cutting anti-patterns live in `references/style-recipes/INDEX.md` (~150 lines). The full catalog is never loaded at once. The 25 recipes are spread across 7 schools (the 6 Direction-Advisor schools plus a *Specialty / Genre* school reachable only via direct anchor names):

| School | Recipes |
|---|---|
| Editorial / Minimalist | `apple-hig` · `muji-kenya-hara` · `aesop` · `dieter-rams-braun` · `monocle-magazine` |
| Information Architecture | `pentagram` · `vignelli-swiss-helvetica` · `bloomberg-terminal` · `tufte-dataink` · `nyt-the-daily` |
| Modern Tool / Builder SaaS | `linear` · `vercel-mesh` · `raycast` · `notion-pre-ai` |
| Motion / Experimental | `field-io` · `active-theory` · `resn-storytelling` |
| Brutalist / Raw | `are-na` · `bloomberg-businessweek-turley` · `balenciaga-post-2017` |
| Warm Humanist | `mailchimp-freddie` · `stripe-press` · `headspace-meditation` |
| Specialty / Genre | `y2k-retrofuturism` · `mid-century-modern` |

## Background

This skill is inspired by the system prompt of [Claude Design](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-design-anthropic-labs), Anthropic's visual design product launched in April 2026. Claude Design's system prompt (~420 lines) encodes a sophisticated set of design principles, anti-patterns, and workflow constraints that make its output consistently high-quality.

This project extracts and refines those core ideas into a portable skill that works with any AI coding agent — giving you Claude-Design-level design taste without the product lock-in or usage limits.

Key additions beyond the original Claude Design prompt:
- **Design system declaration step** — forces the AI to articulate design tokens in natural language before coding
- **v0 draft strategy** — a concrete methodology for showing work-in-progress early
- **Extended anti-cliché list** — additional patterns identified from real-world AI output
- **Placeholder philosophy** — a complete framework for handling missing assets professionally
- **Color × font pairing table** — six validated visual system starting points
- **Design Direction Advisor** — six-school conversational tool for vague requests, with explicit handoff to the recipe library
- **25-recipe anchored style library** — each recipe tied to a real brand / studio / designer with concrete copy-able values; defends against AI-default mush
- **Advanced pattern library** — ready-to-use code templates for common UI patterns
